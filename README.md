## Introduction

The DummyGenny is a Python script designed to generate dummy data for testing and demonstration purposes. It allows you to specify the number of columns and the number of data entries to generate. You can define the column names, data types (integer, date, or string), and ranges for each column.

The generated data is then saved to a CSV file, making it easy to import into other applications or analyze using spreadsheet software.

## Features

- Support for three data types: integer, date, and string.
- Define specific ranges for date and integer columns.
- Specify external CSV files as a source for string column values.
- Automatically assigns an index column.
- Saves generated data to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CSV module (comes pre-installed with Python)

3. Run the script:
